This is a class project from Networking. We worked in groups of two. 

For this project, we implemented a window-based reliable data transfer built on top of GoBackN protocol with and without congestion control over UDP. There was no project skeleton. Everything in this folder was written by ourselves. We got full score for this project, and 10% extra credit(this is the maximum) for implementing slow start, congestion avoidance and fast recovery. 

To run the project, please refer to the manual section in report.pdf. You can change the packet size, packet loss rate and packet corruption rate in packet.c.
